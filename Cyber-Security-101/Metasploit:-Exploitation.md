[Cyber Security 101 - Metasploit: Exploitation](https://tryhackme.com/room/metasploitexploitation)


## Key Points
- use 'search portscan' on metasploit to search for potential port scanning modules.
- use 'show options' to show module options(use this command after choosing a module).
- In metasploit you can directly perform _Nmap_
- To perform a scan, choose a module and then type 'run [ip]'.
- Metasploit database postgresSQL. (I don't really know what this means)
- learn about **sessions** (It's Important) 'session -i'
- learn about kinds of payload and handler (Metasploit is huge)
- learn about chmod, wget, and msfvenom

## New Vocabulary (My Personal learning)
1. SMB : allows computers to communicate over the network to share files or send files to printers.
2. NetBIOS : (Similar to SMB)

## Conclusion
This room makes me dive deeper in metasploit especially in exploit stuff. Even though this is one of the most hardest room i've encountered in TryHackMe, I still enjoyed the 2 hours it took me to complete this room. It shows me about how to session an exploit, how to prep the metasploit database, and using msfvenom.
