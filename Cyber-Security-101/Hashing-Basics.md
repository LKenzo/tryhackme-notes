## Key Points
- Hash can be used to verify a download. It compares two hash-values and if it's the same then it's most likely identical.
- A hash-value itself is a fixed-size string that is computed by a hash function.
- The difference between hash and encryption is, hash has no key and it's build to be impossible to reverse the output.
- Hashing plays a crucial role in our daily use of internet. Hashing helps protect data's integrity and confidentiality.
- One way to crack password that use hash without adding salt is using rainbow table. (**CrackStation and Hashes.com**)
- Adding salt is another way to make hash stronger and harder to crack. Salt adds a random generated value stored in the database, salt  can make even a same password to a different hash value.
- Use online tools like hashcat or JohnTheRipper to crack hash code without salt.

## Conclusion
In this room i learn the difference between hash function, encoding, and encryption. I find it interesting that there are people who can crack the old module of hash like MD5 or SHA1. Without hash function it will be hard to secure data's confidentiality and integrity.
