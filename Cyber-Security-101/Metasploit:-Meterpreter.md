# Metasploit: Meterpreter
[Cyber Security 101 - Metasploit: Meterpreter](https://tryhackme.com/room/meterpreter)

## Key Points
- Meterpreter is a metasploit payload that supports the penetration testing process. Meterpreter will run on the **target system** and act as an agent command and control architecture
- Meterpreter runs in memory and does not write itself to the disk target, this aims to avoid being detected.
- There are several versions of meterpreter:
  - Android
  - Apple iOS
  - Java
  - Linux
  - OSX
  - PHP
  - Python
  - Windows
- use 'help' command to list all available commands.
- use 'migrate' to migrate to another process (This can be used to capture keystrokes sent by the user)

## Conclusion
I think this room is much simpler than the previous room, It review most of the content of the previous room.
